    "There are two different equations for the Heston characteristic function. These two equations are in fact equavelant as it is observed in the correspoding paper. However, the biggest issue is \"d\"'s sign where is flipped around in these two equations meaning that it can be either negative or positive. This occurs from the fact that \"d\" is a complex root that has two different values and the second value is given by substracting the first one. Additionally, the branch cut seems to be the main problem here. A branch cut is where the a function is discontinuous in the complex plane. As someone increases \"u\" in Ï•_1(u,t) the main value of the complex square root basically moves to the negative real axis. This causes a discontinuous function to appear which is the problem of the numerical calculations. Further, some of the mispricings that are caused by that discontinuous function are not always noticable. \n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to tackle these mispricings is to use the Ï•_2(u,t) along the main value of the square root. That way numerical calculations are more stable since the discontinuities do not appear. Another one, more recent, is to restrict certain parameters. "
