# IMI
Few tasks in python from courses I had to attend in my masters. Also python scripts from an independent course. Further, construction of my thesis artificial stock market and analysis of OMSX30 index.

LSTM_model.ipynb was made for a university project which was 2.5 months. 

MarkovChain_Stylizedfacts.ipynb is a file that contains a Markov Chain class and its usage. Also some stylized facts where they have to do with manipulations of financial data.

OMSX30.ipynb is for my master thesis. It is an analysis of OMSX30 index by using some standard ways like examination of the returns of prices. I also use GARCH there. 

Tasks_in_Financial_Engineering(1-3).ipynb are the files that describe different operations with data frames, the usage of functions and classes to achieve certain financial outcomes.

artificial_stock_market.ipynb is the file that consists my complex system model by simulating it as an agend-based model. The purpose of this was to immitate a complex system as the stock market and be able to study the dynamics of behind the market when COVID-19 hits it.

Additionally, 3 pdfs with some coding of a free standing course in physics with every detail written there.
