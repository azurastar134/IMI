A small project in a C# course using generic types and collections with generic objects.
Please read first the pdf file to understand better what I am doing in the assignment. 
I have not added any comments because it was a bit later in the course and it was not needed according to the instructions of the teachers.
Additionally, I have a few more assignments from two courses I have taken 1.5 years ago at Malm√∂ Universitet in case you are interested.
